# Kellerabend - The Game

This is a Commodore 64 BASIC Textadventure, written by the community and Captain Raver during live Twitch Streams.
Every Saturday (if not impassable) at around 9:30 CEST we stream here:

The Game is dedicated to all the nice people I met on Twitch, or even live!

Feel free to ask questions or make suggestions. I know there are a lot of typos and a hell of things could be written better - but this is how "WE" as a community worked it out.
